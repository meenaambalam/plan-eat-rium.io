Dine-in helper application that helps you plan your weekly menu with various choices
```

## Description
```
The most challenging part of cooking is planning what you want to cook and when and what ingredients I have already and I what I need to buy, etc.
The actual part of cooking and following a recipe is the least challenging part.

This App is a perfect solution for that. 
This let's you search for recipes with the ingredients you have in the fridge. Give many recipe choices to choose from. It lists the recipe ingredients, so you can shop for the ingredients you may not have at home. 

It also lets you add the the recipe name and link to the weekly calendar, so that you can go back to it, on the day you are cooking to pull up the actual recipe.
